  aboutMe: `
  Lead AI Sofware Engineer at Afiniti Inc. with an interdisciplinary skillset spanning statistical modeling, machine learning, and software engineering.
  
  I am currently building Afinti's AiRo: a no-code, self-service, turnkey solution for AI-powered real-time contact center pairing and CX optimization.

  Previously, as a Data Scientist at Afiniti, I built Bayesian models to optimize contact-center pairing for some of the world's leading telecos, delivering millions of dollars in incremental lifetime value retained.
  
  I have a Master's Degree in Computer Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning from Georgia Institute of Technology. 
  
  My research interests include LLMs, Applied AI, and statistical modeling.
